# TCP/IP

- ### TCP/IP is the most fundamental protocol used in the internet.
	- Allows computer to communicate / share resources.
	- Used as a standard.
	- To bridge the gap between non-compatible platforms.
- ### Work on TCP/IP started in 1970's
	- Funded by US military.
	- Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA)
- ### TCP/IP does not strictly follow OSI model , it follows a simplified 4-layer model.

# TCP/IP protocol suite
- ### Refers to a family of protocols.
- ### The protocols are built on top of connectionless technology(==Datagram==).
	- Data sent from one node to another as a sequence of datagrams.
	- Each datagram is sent independently.
	- The datagrams corresponding to same message may follow different routes ( variable delay, arrival order at destination).
